    "    \"## Introduction\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"In this lab, you'll calculate various distances between multiple points using the distance metrics you learned about!\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"## Objectives\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"In this lab you will:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- Calculate Manhattan distance between two points \\n\",\n",
    "    \"- Calculate Euclidean distance between two points\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- Calculate Minkowski distance between two points\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"## Getting Started\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"You'll start by writing a generalized function to calculate any of the three distance metrics you've learned about. Let's review what you know so far:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"> The **_Manhattan distance_** and **_Euclidean distance_** are both special cases of **_Minkowski distance_**. \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Take a look at the formula for Minkowski distance below:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"$$\\\\large d(x,y) = \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_i - y_i|^c\\\\right)^\\\\frac{1}{c}$$  \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"**_Manhattan distance_** is a special case where $c=1$ in the equation above (which means that you can remove the root operation and just keep the summation).  \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"**_Euclidean distance_** is a special case where $c=2$ in the equation above.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Knowing this, you can create a generalized `distance()` function that calculates Minkowski distance, and takes in `c` as a parameter. That way, you can use the same function for every problem, and still calculate Manhattan and Euclidean distance metrics by just passing in the appropriate values for the `c` parameter!\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"In the cell below:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"* Complete the `distance()` function which should implement the Minkowski distance equation above to return the distance, a single number  \\n\",\n",
    "    \"* This function should take in 4 arguments:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"    * `a`: a tuple or array that describes a vector in n-dimensional space  \\n\",\n",
    "    \"    * `b`: a tuple or array that describes a vector in n-dimensional space (this must be the same length as `a`!)\\n\",\n",
    "    \"    * `c`: which tells us the norm to calculate the vector space (if set to `1`, the result will be Manhattan, while `2` will calculate Euclidean distance) \\n\",\n",
    "    \"    * `verbose`: set to `True` by default. If true, the function should print out if the distance metric returned is a measurement of Manhattan, Euclidean, or Minkowski distance \\n\",\n",
    "    \"    \\n\",\n",
    "    \"* Since euclidean distance is the most common distance metric used, this function should default to using `c=2` if no value is set for `c` \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"**_HINT:_** \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"1. You can avoid using a `for` loop like we did in the previous lesson by simply converting the tuples to NumPy arrays \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"2. Use `np.power()` as an easy way to implement both squares and square roots. `np.power(a, 3)` will return the cube of `a`, while `np.power(a, 1/3)` will return the cube root of 3. For more information on this function, refer the [NumPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.power.html)!\"\n",
