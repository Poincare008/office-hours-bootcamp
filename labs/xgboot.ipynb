    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll install the popular [XGBoost](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library and explore how to use this popular boosting model to classify different types of wine using the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Dataset Repository.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Run this lab on your local computer.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Open up a new terminal window \n",
    "2. Activate your conda environment\n",
    "3. Run `pip install xgboost`\n",
    "4. Once the installation has completed, run the cell below to verify that everything worked "
